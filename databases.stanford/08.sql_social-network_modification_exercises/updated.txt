1. It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler. 

# ok
delete from Highschooler
where grade = 12

2. If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple. 

# ok
# yeees, i did it!
delete from Likes
where (id1 || '-' || id2) in
  (select id1 || '-' || id2
     from (select *
             from Likes L
            where exists
                 (select * from Friend F
                   where F.id1 = L.id1 and F.id2 = L.id2)
   except
   select id2, id1 from Likes))

3. For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. 

# ok
insert into Friend
  select F1.id1, F2.id2
    from Friend F1 join Friend F2
     on F1.id2 = F2.id1 and F1.id1 <> F2.id2
  except
  select * from Friend
