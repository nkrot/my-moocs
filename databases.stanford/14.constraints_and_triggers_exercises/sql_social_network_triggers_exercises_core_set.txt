q1. Write a trigger that makes new students named 'Friendly' automatically like everyone else in their grade. That is, after the trigger runs, we should have ('Friendly', A) in the Likes table for every other Highschooler A in the same grade as 'Friendl

# ok +++
Create trigger Friendly
After insert on Highschooler
For each row
when New.name = "Friendly"
begin
  insert into Likes
  select New.ID, H.ID from Highschooler H
  where New.grade = H.grade and New.name <> H.name;
end;

q2. Write one or more triggers to manage the grade attribute of new Highschoolers. If the inserted tuple has a value less than 9 or greater than 12, change the value to NULL. On the other hand, if the inserted tuple has a null value for grade, change it to 9.

# ok +++
create trigger GradeOutOfRange
after insert on Highschooler
For each row
when New.grade < 9 or New.grade > 12
begin
  update Highschooler
  set grade = NULL
  where grade <9 or grade > 12;
end
|
Create trigger FixNullGrade
after insert on Highschooler
for each row
when New.grade is NULL
begin
  update Highschooler
  set grade = 9
  where grade is NULL;
end

q3. Write a trigger that automatically deletes students when they graduate, i.e., when their grade is updated to exceed 12.

# ok +++
Create trigger DeleteGraduated
after update of grade on Highschooler
for each row
when New.grade > 12
begin
  delete from Highschooler
  where grade > 12;
end;
