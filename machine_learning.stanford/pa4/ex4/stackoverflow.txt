The question is about bulk-changing values in a matrix based on data contained in a vector.

Suppose I have a matrix 5x4 matrix of zeroes.

octave> Z = zeros(5,4)

Z =

   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0

And a column vector of length equal to the number of rows in Z, that is, 5. The rows in the vector y correspond to rows in the matrix Z.

octave> y = [1; 3; 2; 1; 3]

y =

   1
   3
   2
   1
   3

What I want is to set 1's in the matrix Z in the columns whose indices are contained as values in the vector y. Namely, I'd like to have Z matrix like this:

Z =

   1   0   0   0
   0   0   1   0
   0   1   0   0
   1   0   0   0
   0   0   1   0

Is there a concise way of doing it? I know I can implement it using a loop over y, but I have a feeling Octave could have a more laconic way. I am new to Octave.
