The standard deviation of Y is 2. The standard deviation of X is 4.The correlation coefficient between X and Y is 0.8 (rho=0.8). What is the value of the slope in the linear regression equation Y=aX+b.

a = rho * sigma(y) / sigma(x)

sigma = standard deviation


a = 0.8 * 2 / 4 = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.40

2 = 0.4*4 + b
b = 2 - 0.4*4 = 0.4 ???
