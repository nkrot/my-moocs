# Assume there are 100 entities occurring in three locations on a Cartesian plane, A=(1,0), B=(1, 20), C=(1, 21).
# Consider two different distributions of entities among the locations:
#  (I)   1 falls in A, 49 in B and 50 in C;
#  (II) 34 fall  in A, 33 in B and 33 in C.
# Consider the task of partitioning of the entity set in K=2 clusters according to K-means criterion with
#  distances being the squared Euclidean distances.
# What is the optimal two-cluster partition in case (I)?
# Answers:
#  1) A+C, and B
#  2) A+B, and C
#  3) A,   and B+C -- my answer

# Question 13
# ===========
# Is the optimal partition in case (II) any different from the optimal partition for case (I) under conditions of Question 12?
# Choose the optimal condition for the case (II).
# 1) A+B, and C
# 2) A, and B+C -- my answer
# 3) A+C, and B
