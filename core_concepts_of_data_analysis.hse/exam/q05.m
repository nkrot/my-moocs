# A student presented two loading vectors c1 and c2 as results of their PCA analysis over a 100x3 table:
#   c1 	      c2
# 0.2673 	 0.3015
# 0.5345 	-0.3015
# 0.8018 	-0.9045
# The instructor said: This cannot be, thus wrong. Why? Choose the right answer.
#
# 1) They are normed to unity, not to the square roots of the singular values
# 2) Vector c2 contains a negative value -- false
# 3) They are not orthogonal -- my option, random guessing
# 4) The dimension of the vectors should be 100, not 3 -- false
